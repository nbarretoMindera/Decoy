/// The core of the Decoy mocking framework, which intercepts network requests to return
/// pre-configured mock responses or record live responses. Decoy is designed primarily for use
/// in UI tests to simulate network responses without performing real network calls.
///
/// Decoy operates by loading mock responses (stubs) from disk using a `Loader`, queuing them for
/// retrieval, and intercepting network requests via mechanisms such as a custom `URLProtocol`
/// or Apollo interceptors. Depending on the configured operating mode, Decoy can either return
/// queued mocks, perform live network requests, or record live responses for later playback.
///
/// ### Usage
/// To use Decoy, ensure your UI test environment sets the appropriate environment variables
/// (`DECOY_IS_XCUI`, `DECOY_MODE`, `DECOY_MOCK_DIRECTORY`, and `DECOY_MOCK_FILENAME`). At app launch
/// or test setup, call `setUp()` to load and queue mocks. Use `Decoy.urlSession` to obtain a
/// `URLSession` configured to intercept requests. The `reset()` method can be called between tests
/// to clear shared state.
///
/// Decoy integrates with other components like `Loader` (for reading mocks), `Writer` (for saving
/// recorded responses), and `Recorder` (for capturing live responses). It provides a centralized
/// mechanism to control network behavior during UI tests, improving test reliability and speed.
